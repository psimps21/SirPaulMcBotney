# SirPaulMcBotney

This work started as course project by Tom Keaty (tkeaty) and Parker Simpson (psimps21) for 10-615: Art and Machine Learning taught by **Dr. Eunsu Kang** at Carnegie Mellon University.

A major motivating factor behind this project is the lack of bass players in the amateur community, as most musicians gravitate towards the guitar as a first step. Nevertheless, having a skilled bassist is vital to the success of a four-piece band, and if there are no recruits around, would it be possible to add the virtual accompaniment of one of the most iconic bassists of all time? This is the inspiration behind our creation, Sir Paul McBotney.
